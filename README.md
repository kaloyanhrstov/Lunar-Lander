# Lunar-Lander

The Lunar Lander project aims to train an agent using reinforcement learning techniques to solve the LunarLander-v2 environment provided by OpenAI Gymnasium. The project utilizes the Tianshou library for reinforcement learning implementations. 
It includes utilities for logging training data, visualizing learning curves, and recording agent performance videos. The main part of the code orchestrates the training process, including setting up the environment, defining the neural network architecture,
configuring the training parameters, and executing the training loop. The trained agent's performance is evaluated using learning curves and recorded videos
(The videos are visible on Google Colab -https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PSgWgQs8qo1aQdAekZsZNhZURDN0RDCo?usp=sharing).
